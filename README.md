# To-Do Management System

This is a To-Do Management System, written in React Native with Expo.

## How To Use

Clone the repository, and enter the directory in the shell, then run these command below:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
yarn
expo start
```

Now you can edit code and see changes in real-time on your devices.

## Build

**If you want to build iOS App, you need a Apple Development Menbership.**

**It's strongly recommended to set your own bundle id for your Project.**

Run `npm install -g eas-cli` and follow the [instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/).
